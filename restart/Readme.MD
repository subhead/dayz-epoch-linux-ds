Here are scripts to allow Battleye to send a message when a restart is due, there is a file in the root folder with useful cron jobs you can use and that you will need to add for this to work, these cron jobs are set to go off for 3 hour restarts, you will need to modify them if you have later restarts..    I did not create these all credit goes to JPhix 

Edit the config.php to specify your servers IP,Port and Password, Battleye must be enabled for these to work.of them :/

If you use a Distro that uses APT then copy this

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install php5 php5-cgi spawn-fcgi

and if it moans then you can try

sudo apt-get install -f 

finally Restart apache
service apache2 restart
```

***

How to install

Edit the config.php to specify your servers IP,Port and Password, Battleye must be enabled for these to work.

then you can either use the crons I provide for a 3 hour restart or create your own All you need to do is change the location of the files
